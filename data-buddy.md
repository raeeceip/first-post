# Building DataBuddy: A Wails Application for Data Organization

## Introduction

In this blog post, we'll explore the process of building DataBuddy, a desktop application inspired by the [Maestro](https://github.com/overture-stack/maestro) project. DataBuddy aims to help users organize and index their data efficiently without the need for Elasticsearch. We'll be using Wails, Next.js, and Go to create this application, with SQLite as our database solution.

## Project Overview

DataBuddy is designed to be a lightweight alternative to Maestro, focusing on two primary features:

1. Data Indexing: Upload and process data from various file formats (starting with CSV).
2. Data Arranging: Organize and view the indexed data in a user-friendly interface.

Let's dive into the planning and design aspects of building DataBuddy.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: Next.js with shadcn/ui for a modern, responsive UI
- Backend: Go for efficient data processing and API endpoints
- Desktop Framework: Wails to package the application for desktop environments
- Database: SQLite for local data storage

## Detailed Design

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend will consist of several key components:

1. Upload Page: Allow users to select and upload data files.
2. Indexing Status Page: Show progress and results of the indexing process.
3. Data Explorer: A dynamic interface for viewing and arranging indexed data.
4. Search Component: Enable users to search through their indexed data.

Key considerations:
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for file uploads.
- Create reusable components for data visualization (tables, charts, etc.).

### Backend (Go)

The backend will handle the core functionality of DataBuddy:

1. File Processing: Extract data from uploaded files (initially focusing on CSV).
2. Indexing Logic: Create an efficient indexing system inspired by Maestro.
3. Data Storage: Manage the SQLite database for storing processed data.
4. API Layer: Provide endpoints for the frontend to interact with the data.

Key considerations:
- Use goroutines for concurrent processing of large datasets.
- Implement a flexible schema to accommodate various data types.
- Create a robust error handling system for data processing issues.

### Data Model

Design a flexible data model that can accommodate various types of data:

```go
type DataEntry struct {
    ID          string    `json:"id"`
    Source      string    `json:"source"`
    ContentType string    `json:"content_type"`
    IndexedAt   time.Time `json:"indexed_at"`
    Data        []byte    `json:"data"`  // Store as JSON
}
```

### Indexing Process

1. File Upload: User selects a file through the frontend.
2. File Validation: Backend checks file type and structure.
3. Data Extraction: Parse the file and extract relevant data.
4. Indexing: Process the data and create searchable indexes.
5. Storage: Save the processed data and indexes in SQLite.

### Search Functionality

Implement a simple yet effective search system:

1. Create inverted indexes for efficient text search.
2. Use SQLite's FTS5 (Full Text Search) extension for advanced text searching capabilities.
3. Implement filters and sorting options in the frontend for refined searches.

## Development Roadmap

1. Setup Project Structure
   - Initialize Wails project
   - Set up Next.js frontend
   - Configure Go backend

2. Implement Core Features
   - Develop file upload and processing logic
   - Create basic indexing system
   - Set up SQLite database and schema

3. Build User Interface
   - Design and implement upload page
   - Create data explorer component
   - Develop search interface

4. Enhance Indexing and Search
   - Optimize indexing process for large datasets
   - Implement advanced search features

5. Testing and Refinement
   - Conduct thorough testing of all features
   - Optimize performance and user experience

6. Documentation and Deployment
   - Write comprehensive documentation
   - Prepare for initial release

## Challenges and Considerations

- Scalability: Plan for handling large datasets efficiently.
- User Experience: Ensure smooth performance during indexing and searching.
- Data Privacy: Implement proper security measures for handling sensitive data.
- Cross-platform Compatibility: Test and ensure functionality across different operating systems.

## Conclusion

Building DataBuddy as a Wails application with Next.js and Go provides an exciting opportunity to create a powerful, yet user-friendly tool for data organization. By focusing on efficient indexing and a flexible data model, we can create a lightweight alternative to more complex systems like Maestro.

As we progress through the development process, we'll undoubtedly encounter challenges and opportunities for optimization. The key will be maintaining a balance between functionality, performance, and user experience.

Stay tuned for future updates as we bring DataBuddy to life!
